# Lesson 1: The CIA Triad

Welcome to Cybersecurity Fundamentals! The foundation of all information security is a model called the **CIA Triad**. It stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Understanding these three principles is the first step to thinking securely.

### Confidentiality
**Confidentiality is about keeping secrets.** It's the principle of ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized individuals. Think of it as digital privacy. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information is a breach of confidentiality.

*   **Example:** Your personal health records or the company's financial statements should only be visible to you and other authorized personnel.
*   **How we protect it:** Using strong passwords, encryption (scrambling data so it's unreadable without a key), and access control lists (defining who can see what).

### Integrity
**Integrity is about ensuring data is trustworthy and accurate.** It means preventing unauthorized modification or deletion of information. Data should be reliable and not tampered with.

*   **Example:** The amount of money in your bank account should not be alterable by an attacker. A project plan should not be changed without authorization.
*   **How we protect it:** Using file permissions, checksums (a digital fingerprint for data), version control systems, and blockchain technology.

### Availability
**Availability means that information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.** If you can't access your data or services, it's not useful and can halt business operations.

*   **Example:** You should be able to log in to the company's email system during work hours. Our public website must be accessible to customers.
*   **How we protect it:** Using backups, disaster recovery plans, redundant systems (like backup power generators), and protecting against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

# Lesson 1: The Art of Deception

**Social engineering** is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information. The criminals are trying to trick you, not your computer. They prey on human psychologyâ€”our trust, fear, curiosity, and desire to be helpful.

Phishing is the most common form of social engineering.

### Common Psychological Tricks
- **Authority:** Pretending to be someone important, like a CEO or a government official, to intimidate you into acting.
- **Urgency:** Creating a false sense of emergency (e.g., "Your account will be deleted in 1 hour!") to make you act without thinking.
- **Intimidation/Fear:** Threatening you with negative consequences (e.g., "A warrant has been issued for your arrest") if you don't comply.
- **Scarcity/Greed:** Luring you with an offer that seems too good to be true, like winning a lottery you never entered.
- **Helpfulness:** Posing as a help desk technician and asking for your password to "fix a problem."

# Lesson 2: Spotting the Phish

Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to trick you into revealing sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy source. Here's how to spot them.

## Red Flags in Emails
- **Sense of Urgency:** Language like "Urgent Action Required" or "Your Account will be Suspended."
- **Generic Greetings:** "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
- **Poor Grammar and Spelling:** Professional organizations proofread their emails.
- **Suspicious Links:** Hover your mouse over a link (don't click!) to see the actual web address. If it doesn't match the sender, it's likely malicious. **Example:** The link text says <code>www.mybank.com</code>, but the hover-link shows <code>www.hacker-site.net/mybank</code>.
- **Unexpected Attachments:** Be wary of attachments you weren't expecting, especially ZIP files or documents that ask you to "Enable Content" or "Enable Macros."
- **Mismatched Sender Address:** The "From" name might say "IT Support," but the email address might be something strange like <code>it-support@hotmail.com</code>.

## Types of Phishing
- **Spear Phishing:** A targeted attack against a specific individual or company. The email will seem much more personal and may reference your name, job title, or recent projects.
- **Whaling:** A type of spear phishing aimed at senior executives (the "big fish").
- **Smishing (SMS Phishing):** Phishing attacks sent via text message.
- **Vishing (Voice Phishing):** Phishing attacks conducted over the phone.

# Lesson 1: Understanding Malware

**Malware**, short for malicious software, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network.

### Common Types of Malware
- **Virus:** A piece of code that attaches itself to a program or file. It relies on human action (like running the program) to spread from one computer to another.
- **Worm:** Similar to a virus, but it can replicate itself without any human interaction. Worms often spread through network vulnerabilities.
- **Trojan Horse:** Disguises itself as legitimate software to trick you into installing it. Once installed, it can create backdoors, steal data, or install other malware.
- **Spyware:** Secretly observes your activities without permission and reports it to the software's author. It can capture keystrokes, screenshots, and login credentials.
- **Adware:** Software that automatically delivers advertisements. While not always malicious, it can be intrusive and sometimes contains spyware.

        content: `
# Lesson 2: Ransomware Explained

**Ransomware** is one of the most dangerous types of malware. It encrypts a victim's files, making them completely inaccessible. The attacker then demands a ransom payment, usually in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key.

## How Ransomware Spreads
- **Phishing Emails:** The most common method. An email contains a malicious link or an attachment (like a fake invoice) that, when opened, installs the ransomware.
- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Attackers scan the internet for systems with unpatched software (like old versions of Windows or web browsers) and exploit those weaknesses to gain entry.
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** Poorly secured RDP ports are a favorite target for attackers to gain direct access to a network.

## What to Do in an Attack
1.  **ISOLATE:** Immediately disconnect your computer from the network (unplug the network cable and turn off Wi-Fi) to prevent it from spreading to other computers and network drives.
2.  **REPORT:** Contact the IT/Cybersecurity department immediately. Provide as much detail as you can. **Do not try to fix it yourself.**
3.  **DO NOT PAY:** Paying the ransom is not guaranteed to get your files back. It also funds the criminals and encourages more attacks. Our strategy relies on backups and recovery, not paying criminals.

The best defense is prevention: **keep regular backups**, keep your systems patched, use antivirus software, and be extremely cautious of suspicious emails.

        content: `
# Lesson 1: Your First Line of Defense

A strong password is your primary defense against unauthorized access. A weak password is like leaving your front door unlocked.

### What Makes a Strong Password?
- **Length:** **Length is the most important factor.** Aim for at least 14 characters. Longer is always better.
- **Complexity:** Use a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (e.g., <code>!@#$%^&</code>).
- **Uniqueness:** **Never reuse passwords across different sites.** If one site is breached, attackers will use that password to try to access your other accounts.
- **Unpredictability:** Avoid dictionary words, personal information (birthdays, names, pet names), and sequential characters ("12345" or "qwerty").

### The Power of Passphrases
Instead of a complex, hard-to-remember password like <code>R7*t$pL9!z</code>, create a **passphrase**. A passphrase is a sequence of words that is easy for you to remember but hard for a computer to guess.
*   **Example:** <code>Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple</code> is extremely strong and much easier to remember.
*   **Tip:** Add numbers and symbols for even more strength: <code>Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple-2024!</code>

### Password Managers: Your Digital Vault
It's impossible to remember dozens of unique, strong passwords. That's why you should use a **password manager**.
*   It generates and securely stores strong passwords for all your accounts.
*   You only need to remember one strong master password to unlock your vault.
*   Examples include Bitwarden, 1Password, and LastPass.

# Lesson 1: Safe Web Browsing

The internet is a vast resource, but not all parts of it are safe. Following these tips can help you avoid common dangers.

### HTTP vs. HTTPS
Always check for **https://** at the beginning of a website's address, especially on pages where you enter sensitive information (like passwords or credit card numbers).
- **HTTP:** Data is sent in plain text. Anyone snooping on the network can read it.
- **HTTPS:** The 'S' stands for 'Secure'. All data between your browser and the site is encrypted. Most modern browsers will show a padlock icon next to the address for HTTPS sites.

### The Dangers of Public Wi-Fi
Public Wi-Fi networks (in cafes, airports, hotels) are inherently insecure. They are often unencrypted, meaning attackers on the same network can easily intercept your traffic. This is called a "Man-in-the-Middle" attack.
- **Best Practice:** Avoid logging into sensitive accounts like banking, email, or company systems on public Wi-Fi.
- **Solution:** Use a **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**. A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, protecting it even on an untrusted network.

### Think Before You Click or Download
- **Be cautious of pop-ups,** especially those that claim your computer is infected or that you've won a prize. Close them from your taskbar if you can't find the 'X'.
- **Do not download software from untrusted websites.** Stick to official app stores and vendor websites. Pirated software is a common source of malware.
- **Be wary of shortened URLs** (like from bit.ly or t.co), as you can't see the destination. Use a URL expander tool if you are unsure.

# Lesson 1: Security is Physical Too

Cybersecurity isn't just about what happens online. Protecting physical access to devices, documents, and information is a critical part of the puzzle.

### In the Office
- **Clean Desk Policy:** Do not leave sensitive documents (reports, printouts, sticky notes with passwords) on your desk, especially overnight. Store them in locked drawers.
- **Lock Your Screen:** Always lock your computer when you step away. It only takes a few seconds for someone to access an unlocked machine.
  - **Windows Shortcut:** <code>Windows Key + L</code>
  - **Mac Shortcut:** <code>Control + Command + Q</code>
- **Be Aware of Tailgating:** Tailgating is when an unauthorized person follows an authorized person into a secure area. Do not hold a secure door open for someone you don't know. Politely ask them to use their own badge.
- **Visitor Management:** Always escort your visitors and ensure they have a visitor badge. Never leave them unattended in secure areas.

### Working Remotely & In Public
- **Secure Your Home Network:** Change the default administrator password on your home Wi-Fi router. Use a strong WPA2 or WPA3 password.
- **Use a VPN:** Always connect to the company VPN when working remotely. This encrypts your connection and makes it seem as if you are in the office.
- **Separate Work and Personal:** Avoid using work devices for personal activities (like social media or online shopping) and avoid using personal devices for work.
- **Be Mindful of "Shoulder Surfing":** Be aware of your surroundings when working in public places like cafes or airports. Position yourself so that others cannot see your screen. Consider using a privacy screen filter.
- **Secure Storage:** When not in use, store your work laptop and any documents in a secure, locked location at home.
